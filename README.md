#Kids Fun Project
This is a small aspnet core project + ReactJs to build a small SaaS application to manage activities of families with kids.
The product idea is literally unlimited. 
but first things first

## phase 1 
We want to have a fully functional web application that can be used by parents to manage their kids' activity, such as piano practise, homework, chores, sports (Not going to break down further).
It's aimed to be designed to let it similar to many loyalty systems. 
Kids can take tasks (or being assigned tasks), each completed tasks can have some reward points. the points can be redeemed to be used for screen time, toys, money.

## phase 2 
We plan to build the react native mobile app so that both kids and parents (guardian) can manage the tasks.
this is so that kids can sign off some tasks and request to redeem rewards.
The goal is to also build an android TV app so that it can control when the TV can be used. (this need more investigation)

## phase 3 objective
We plan to leverage some LLM to be able to automatically generate some quiz or questions based on the years the kids is in.
